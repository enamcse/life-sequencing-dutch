We intend to generate synthetic versions of both the original CBS data and the data we have created by postprocessing CBS data. In this export request, we include summary statistics of different variables excluding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) respecting anonymity. 

For each spreadsheet, we create at most three different files containing summary statistics. 

For example, a spreadsheet named "x.csv" will have the following corresponding files in this export request: 

1. x_meta.txt
2. x_columns.csv
3. x_covariance.csv

x_meta.txt will contain a dictionary with the following keys: 
i) path: denoting the path of the original file in OSSC
ii) shape: the number of rows and the number of columns in the original file
iii) columns_with_dtypes: a list of pairs where the 1st member is a column name and the 2nd member is the data type (numeric, categorical, etc)
iv) total_nobs: # of rows in the original file (this is repeated in shape too)
v) nobs_sumstat: # of rows we sampled for creating the summary statistics for this spreadsheet. For extremely huge spreadsheets, we sampled a moderate number of rows and created the summary statistics. 
vi) has_pii_columns: the PII columns that the original file had and we did not include in x_columns.csv

x_columns.csv will contain 15 columns and the # of rows will be equal to the number of variables(columns) in the original spreadsheet. The 15 columns are: 
i) variable_name: name of the variable in the original spreadsheet
ii) median: median value for numeric variable
iii) mean: ^ same for mean
iv) std_dev: ^ same for standard deviation
v) 10th_percentile: the value of the data at the 10th percentile
vi) 90th_percentile: ^ same for the 90th percentile
vii) q1: ^ same for the 25th percentile
viii) q3: ^ same for the 75th percentile
ix) null_fraction: fraction of rows that were empty
x) category_top_0: for categorical variables, the name of the category with the highest frequency and the relative frequency of that category within this dataset.
xi - xiv) category_top_1	category_top_2	category_top_3	category_top_4: ^ same for the the next top 4 categories.
xv) _others: total relative frequency of all other categories

x_covariance.csv will be only created for spreadsheets that has at least one numeric variable. It will be a (n+1)x(n+1) table where n = # of numeric variables the original spreadsheet has. The first row and column will contain names of the numeric variables. The cell in the i-th row and the j-th column would denote the covariance between the i-th and the j-th numeric variable. This is a symmetric matrix. 

For all statistics, we use all the rows (typically in the millions for all of them), or we sample with at least 1000 data points. For every file x, the number of rows used can be found at nobs_sumstat of x_meta.txt or if it is empty/None, then at total_nobs of x_meta.txt. If nobs_sumstat is not None but not a binding limit, all rows are used.
