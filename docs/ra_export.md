The latest instructions for making exports from the RA are here: https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/cbs/onze-diensten/maatwerk/zelf-onderzoek-doen/guidelines-for-ra-output.pdf


The following are particularly important 
- Data need to be in tabular format. Allowed file formats are xls, doc, txt and csv
- No individual linking variables, such as RINPERSOON, RINADRES, BEID, BRIN, can
be included in the output.
- max and min are not released
- Variables in the output should be documented 
- Giving a clear explanation of the output can speed up the export process (and possibly save cost)


I recommend also to report the total number of underlying records. It's often not a problem, but a handy to check quickly before exporting.
