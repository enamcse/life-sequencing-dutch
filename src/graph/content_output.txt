The keys refer to the different types of networks (family, household, colleague, neighbour, education), as well as to the intersection of two of these network types combined.

The summary statistics are on the number of connections per person in the respective networks: mean, median, standard deviation, 10th and 90th percentile, fraction non-zero. These values are also computed for every pairwise layer intersection, i.e., the proportion of family connections which are also present in your household network.
