A zipped file containing multiple json files in .txt format. Each json file corresponds to one tabular data file we want to create synthetic data for. We extract the following summary statistics and save them in key-value pairs in the json file.

metadata:
path: where we have stored the original file in OSSC
shape: the number of rows and columns of the original csv
columns_with_dtypes: column names along with their data types
cov_matrix: covariance matrix for numerical columns
numeric_columns: names of columns that are numeric


For numeric columns:
median 
mean 
standard deviation 
10th_percentile 
90th_percentile 
q1 (the first quartile)
q3 (the second quartile)

For categorical columns:
fraction of rows for the 200 most frequent categories and one entry for others

For all columns:
null_fraction (the number of rows with null values)
